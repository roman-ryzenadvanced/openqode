# Fix Real-Time Counter Updates

## Problem
Sidebar counters (Chars/Toks/Speed) stay at "0" or barely move because the character count update was accidentally restricted to "Thinking" chunks only. Normal text generation was ignored.

## Proposed Change
In `opencode-ink.mjs` (Streaming Loop):
- Move `setThinkingStats(... chars + chunk.length)` **outside** the `if (isThinkingChunk)` block.
- This ensures **every single character** generated by the AI contributes to the counter and drives the speedometer.

## Verification
1.  **Restart App** (Option 5).
2.  **Generate Text**: Ask "Write a poem".
3.  **Observe**:
    -   `Chars` should rapidly increase.
    -   `Speed` (cps) should show a number > 0.
    -   The activity should be visible immediately.
